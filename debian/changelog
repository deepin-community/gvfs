  * Team upload
  * d/p/gvfs-test-Kill-home-test_polkitd.py-correctly.patch:
    Add patch to fix the autopkgtest when run in autopkgtest-virt-qemu.
    The home/test_polkitd.py script wasn't terminated correctly, causing
    the testbed to wait indefinitely for it to exit.
    - d/tests/control: Depend on procps, for pkill(1)
  * d/tests: Make use of the needs-sudo restriction.
    This was added to autopkgtest in Debian 12 (specifically version
    5.26, see #906424) and makes the use of sudo in gvfs' integration
    test script something that can be supported by any sufficiently
    capable backend.  In the case of gvfs, autopkgtest-virt-lxc as used
    on ci.debian.net is not sufficient, but maintainers can now run the
    test in autopkgtest-virt-qemu.
  * Add more details of the changes in the previous two changelog entries
